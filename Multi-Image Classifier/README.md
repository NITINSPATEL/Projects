- Dataset - CIFAR10 (60K images , 32*32 pixels , 10 classes)
- 

## Applications ##
- Self-Driving Cars
- Facial Recognition
- Surveillance


# Overview #
- Simple ANN took over 11 min and that too for 49% accuracy
- CNN model worked in 4 min and got a whooping 79%+ accuracy
- With CNN, at the end 5 epochs, accuracy was at around 70% which is a significant improvement over ANN. CNN's are best for image classification and gives superb accuracy. Also computation is much less compared to simple ANN as maxpooling reduces the image dimensions while still preserving the features
- Max pooling layer was the main reason for less time of processing of CNN model
